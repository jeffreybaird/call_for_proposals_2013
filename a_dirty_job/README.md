A Dirty Job - can FRP clean up the web?

A quick search turns up over 200 different programming lanugages that
compile to JavaScript. All of these are trying to solve percieved issues with
JavaScript.  I can't speak to what problems all of these languages are
trying to solve, but I know the problem I have: Programming on the web makes
me feel dirty.

Instead of trying to avoid the world of CSS, HTML and JavaScript, I started
to look for alternatives. My search lead to a paradigm called Functional
Reactive Programming, or FRP, and a new language called Elm.

I have several goals for this talk. After I introduce the Ruby community
to Elm, I'll discuss the challenges I faced with Elm as a new programmer
and complete n00b to the functional world. I also plan to point out the
aspects of the language that leave something to be desired, and I hope to
leave the attendees with a balanced introduction to FRP.
