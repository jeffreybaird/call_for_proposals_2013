# Grow Your Own Developers

In February 2012 I had never written a line of code. As of July 11th I am
employed as a full-time Ruby developer at Medivo, a health management
company.

As they need for developers grows, many companies are left understaffed or
outsourcing much of their work. They frequently fail to consider growing
their own.

I want to discuss my experiences jumping into the Ruby community with both
feet, how I was hired with almost no experience, how companies can
successfully mimic what Medivo did with me, and the potential pitfalls of
hiring a junior programmer.

## Jeffrey Baird

I am a commerical sailor turned programmer. I've started two companies, one
funded by a Global Accelerator Network program, and I now work as a
developer at Medivo in New York City.

## About the talk

I gave this talk at Ruby Hoedown and Hurriconf (the impromptu NYC ruby
conference after Hurricane Sandy). Both times it was very well recieved.
If it is accepted for Ancient Ruby I plan on expanding the talk to include
more specific examples on how to best utilize junior programmers without
dragging on the productivity of your senior team.
